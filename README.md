# Summer-Project: Modeling Medical Cost Data
## Description
For this project, I am using medical cost data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/medical-cost-dataset?resource=download) to create predictive models based on the necessary inputs. I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to create the models since I have most experience using them.
## Inital Data Processing Notebook
This notebook contains some inital data processing. The data is loaded and looked at to see the different parts of the dataset. Additionally, I made some graphs to better understand the relationships between the categories. 
## Modeling Data Notebook
In this notebok, I loaded the data again and created four differnet models that can predict medical costs based off the other categories. The four models are a linear regression model, a decision tree, a random forest model, and a k-nearest neighbors model.
